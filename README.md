Important Disclaimer: I want to emphasize that the game presents a single scenario of how life might have originated on our planet. There are many different ones. The debate on the origin of life probably started in the times of the ancient Greeks and continues to this day, evolving and incorporating new ideas, giving rise to various theories. For example, at one point in the game, thereâ€™s a discussion about "proteins vs. DNA". Some theories suggest that amyloids were at the origin of the first complex molecules. Similarly, the debate is still open as to whether life originated in deep-sea hydrothermal vents or shallow water vents. Therefore, there is no definitive and unique answer, and there probably never will be. Perhaps one day we will discover how life can originate, but it will be difficult to understand it for our planet (since we don't have a time machine).

The game is not intended to be educational; it's just for fun and not for informing. It has the same scientific value as "Tetris". And most importantly, it reflects my personal opinion on the origin of life, not that of the entire scientific community.

I'm also available for any discussions on the topic, which has always fascinated me.
